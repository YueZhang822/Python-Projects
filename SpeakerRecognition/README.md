# Speaker Recognition System #

## Overview ##

This project explores **Markov Models** and **Hash Tables** within the context of computational linguistics and data structure efficiency. It is designed to assess the likelihood that a particular person uttered it by analyzing actual text, through the implementation of Markov Models. Additionally, it delves into the implementation of Hash Tables as a means of efficiently storing and accessing data associations.

## Objectives ##

1. Markov Models Implementation: To develop a system that employs Markov Models to capture the statistical relationships between sequences of letters or words in a language. This will allow us to analyze text for patterns that go beyond mere frequency counts, enabling the assessment of the likelihood of specific sequences (e.g., "to be" vs. "to is") and the authorship of texts.

2. Hash Tables Implementaion: To create a module for Hash Tables for rapid data retrieval. This involves understanding the hashing process, handling collisions, and ensuring data is evenly distributed across the table to avoid "hot spots".
